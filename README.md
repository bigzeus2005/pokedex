## Description 
We made a website for searching a pokemon from the pokemon api that then finds and displays a giphy searched up with that pokemons name. If the giphy is not to your liking there is a button that will find another giphy for you. When the page is opened a random pokemon, its data and accompanying giphy will be generated. Another random pokemon can be generated by pressing the random pokemon button.
