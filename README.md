## Description 
We made a website for searching a pokemon from the pokemon api that then finds and displays a giphy searched up with that pokemons name. If the giphy is not to your liking there is a button that will find another giphy for you. When the page is opened a random pokemon, its data and accompanying giphy will be generated. Another random pokemon can be generated by pressing the random pokemon button.

## Project Status
Project is: initial build completed; future updates to include different search bars, lists, or randomizers that find things from the pokemon api other than just pokemon, such as pokemon items. All of the available moves to a pokemon could be added with the pokemons data, or we could add a button that randomly selects four of a pokemon's moves. The combination of items, moves and pokemon means this sight could be used to either research and build your own pokemon team or randomly generate one.
